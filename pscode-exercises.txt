// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers


user input two numbers

	input number1
	input number2

add the two numbers

	number1 + number2 = sum

print sum



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

check to see if number is even module    

if number % 2 == 0 then the number is even
	print even

else
	print  odd



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 

"Please enter in 5 numbers:"

	Read n1,n2,n3,n4,n5

  
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

Please enter 5 numbers

	read n1,n2,n3,n4,n5

The average is:

	avg= (n1+n2+n3+n3+n4+n5)/5


c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

find the min of five numbers

1. assume n1 to be the smallest (min)
2. If n2 is less than min Then
	Assign n2 to min	
3. If n3 is less than min Then
	Assign n3 to min
4. If n4 is less than min Then
	Assign n4 to min
5. If n5 is less than min Then
	Assign n5 to min	
6. Show value min	

find the max of five numbers

1. assume n1 to be the largest (max)
2. If n2 is greater than max Then
	Assign n2 to max	
3. If n3 is greater than max Then
	Assign n3 to max
4. If n4 is greater than max Then
	Assign n4 to max
5. If n5 is greater than max Then
	Assign n5 to max	
6. Show value max	

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

print avg  "the avg number is:" avg
 
print min  "the min is:" min

print max  "the max is:" max
